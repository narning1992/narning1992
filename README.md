I am a D.Phil candidate at the Big Data Institute at the University of Oxford using machine learning in the field of genomics, having so far worked mostly with eukaryotic, viral and bacterial DNA and Patient biomarkers from the UK Biobank. In my work I combine my knowledge from genomics, computer science, machine learning and applied statistics to make sense of the wealth of big data in bioinformatics. Currently I am working on applying machine learning in infectious disease backgrounds. After finishing my doctoral degree I would like to use my skills in a more applied background to be able to help alleviate the burden of disease using modern solutions.
